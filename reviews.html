My buddy has had nothing but negative reactions and experiences with the groomers. I can't even begin to count the number of people who have been scratched by him in attempts to groom him. I had all but resigned myself to dealing with it all by my self, but then I heard from a friend about Oasis Grooming. I decided to give it a shot, and waited to hear the same horror stories I've heard from other groomers. Only to find that Godwin; Oasis Grooming's offical trouble handler, was surprised about how easy it was to bath and brush him. Instant customer for life."</p>

			<p class="pPadding"><img src="byrd2.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Long-haired Dachshund puppy named Byrd" id="reviewRight"><strong>Byrd's Owner:</strong> "As the owner of this stinky little man, I can't be more grateful about finding Oasis Grooming. Byrd is the first dog I have gotten as a puppy. Meaning, I've been dealing with all the joys that come with it, meaning teething and stinky puppy breath. I had been doing some research on pet grooming, and when I brought it up in a local facebook group I was told about Oasis grooming. I had to get a different dog groomed, so I decided to ask if they would be willing to do solely a teeth cleaning on Byrd since he isn't ready for a groom just yet. They told me yes and when I went to go pick up both dogs, no more puppy breath!"</p>

			<p class="pPadding"><img src="Stinky1.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Brown ferret with white rings named Alfredo" id="reviewLeft2"><strong>Alfredo's Owner:</strong> "Now, ferrets aren't the kind of pets you usually take to a pet groomers. I didn't even try to look up groomers, thats how certain I was about how unlikely I would be able to get him groomed. And I didn't mind doing the grooming myself. But recently, I had a big emergency and knew I would unable to care for my ferrets for a bit. I had a friend willing to watch them but unable to do anything besides basic care (Feeding, playing, making sure they have water, watching them) and I knew with this emergency I would be unable to help either. So I looked up groomers and saw that Oasis Groomers was willing to groom other animals if contacted. I risked it by giving them a call about ferrets, and when Mira answered the phone she said 'I'd love to, this is far from the first ferret I have groomed.' To say I was relieved is a understatement. I still make sure Alfredo is clean, but if I don't have time for whatever reason or need something a little more; I know where I am turning to."</p>
