	<p>Want to know who is helping your beloved pets? Heres a list of our main groomers here!</p>	
		<section class="center">
			<h3><strong>Godwin</strong></h3>
			<p>Our shining knight in a groomer apron, Godwin is our jack of all trades! Unlike our other two groomers, he prides himself on not having a kind of speciality. However, he does have one thing that makes him stand out! If you have high energy or rowdy pets that are difficult to groom and clean for that exact reason, Godwin is more than willing to take a shot. "I always like to give every pet at least a chance!"</p>

			<h3><strong>Mira</strong></h3>
			<p>Mira is our most creative and adventurous groomer. "People only think that only dogs need to go to the groomers. A few people think groomer trips can also include cats. Other animals may not be groomed the same way, but they need some love to." You have a animal that isn't a dog or cat, but want them to be groomed? Mira will much sure your beloved friend will be treated like royalty.</p>

			<h3><strong>Cecilia</strong></h3>
			<p>Our lovely founder! Cecilia first started Oasis Grooming 3 years ago, and does not regret it to this day. Although she can't say she wishes for past days where she wasn't always coverd in animal fur. Still, she continues forward with her goal to help any and all animals to be nice and clean.</p>
